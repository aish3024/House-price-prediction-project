# House-price-prediction-project
Goal It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.   Metric Submissions are evaluated on Mean-Squared-Error,Root-Mean-Squared-Error, Mean Absolute Error, R2 (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2). 

. Read CSV file
2. Check missing values
3. Decide Strategy for Con, Cat features , Cat most_frequent, constant
4. EDA 
6. Feature selection (Forward, Backward) - LinearRegression
7. Train Test Split (Traing Set.csv)
8. Final Model Building (Rigde/Lasso) 
9. Apply Ridge Lasso with GridSearchCV
10. Model Predction for train, test split
11. Evaluate model with MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2 , R2_adj
12. Predict the testing_set.csv
